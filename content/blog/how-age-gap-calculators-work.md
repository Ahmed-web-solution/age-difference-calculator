# How Age Gap Calculators Work

Age difference calculators involve fascinating mathematical concepts and calendar complexities. This guide explores how they work.

## The Algorithm

Modern calculators use date mathematics to compute accurate age differences while handling leap years, variable month lengths, and time zones.

## Real-World Applications

- Legal contexts (age of consent, contracts)
- Healthcare (development milestones)
- Genealogy (family trees)
- Relationships (compatibility)
